### **Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Protecting Your Web Applications**

#### **Introduction**
In the age of digital transformation, web security has become a critical aspect of any business. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the most common and dangerous vulnerabilities, frequently appearing on the OWASP Top Ten list. Attackers exploit XSS to inject malicious scripts into web applications, potentially compromising sensitive data or taking control of user sessions. In this guide, we'll explore what XSS is, its different types, real-world examples, and how you can protect your applications using Rebackk's Sentinel tool.

### **What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into otherwise trusted websites. These scripts run in the context of a user’s browser, leading to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of web pages.

#### **Types of XSS Attacks**
1. **Stored XSS**: The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a database). When users access the affected page, the script executes in their browser.
2. **Reflected XSS**: The attacker's payload is reflected off a web server, typically in error messages or search results. The script is executed immediately when a user interacts with a specially crafted URL.
3. **DOM-Based XSS**: The vulnerability exists in the client-side code rather than the server-side. It occurs when JavaScript modifies the DOM with untrusted data, leading to script execution.

### **How XSS Works: A Real-World Example**

Imagine a user visiting a website with a vulnerable comment section. If the website does not sanitize user inputs, an attacker could insert the following script:

```html
<script>alert('You have been hacked!');</script>
```

Whenever someone views the infected page, the script will execute, showing an alert box. While this example is harmless, real attacks can steal cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

### **How to Detect XSS Vulnerabilities**
Using **Sentinel**, Rebackk’s AI-powered vulnerability scanner, you can quickly identify XSS vulnerabilities in your web applications. Here's how it works:

1. **Run a Scan**:
   ```bash
   npx sentinel-scanner --target https://yourwebsite.com
   ```
2. **Analyze the Results**:
   - Sentinel provides detailed reports highlighting any vulnerabilities found, including potential XSS issues.
   - It offers recommendations on how to patch these vulnerabilities.

### **Best Practices for Preventing XSS Attacks**

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
   - Use libraries like DOMPurify to sanitize user-generated content.
   - Avoid using `innerHTML` to insert data into the DOM. Instead, use `textContent` or safer methods.

2. **Escape User Inputs**:
   - Escape data based on the context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.).
   - Use security headers like `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)` to prevent script execution.

   ```http
   Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self';
   ```

3. **Implement HTTP-Only and Secure Cookies**:
   - Use `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for cookies to prevent attackers from accessing session data.
   - Example:
     ```http
     Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure
     ```

4. **Enable Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**:
   - A WAF can help detect and block malicious traffic before it reaches your application.
