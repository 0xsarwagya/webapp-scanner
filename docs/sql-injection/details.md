### **Understanding SQL Injection (SQLi): Protecting Your Web Applications**

#### **Introduction**
SQL Injection (SQLi) is one of the most dangerous and prevalent web vulnerabilities, regularly appearing on the OWASP Top Ten list. Attackers exploit SQLi to manipulate backend databases through malicious SQL queries. By injecting malicious code into a website's input fields or URL parameters, attackers can view, modify, or delete data, potentially leading to significant security breaches. In this guide, we’ll explore what SQL Injection is, the different types of SQLi attacks, real-world examples, and how you can protect your applications using Rebackk's Sentinel tool.

### **What is SQL Injection (SQLi)?**
SQL Injection is a vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with the queries your application sends to its database. By injecting malicious SQL code into input fields (like login forms, search bars, or URL parameters), attackers can manipulate or extract sensitive data, bypass authentication, or even execute administrative database commands.

#### **Types of SQL Injection Attacks**
1. **In-band SQLi (Classic SQLi)**:  
   This is the most common form of SQLi. The attacker uses the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results, such as through error messages or retrieving data from the database.

2. **Blind SQLi**:  
   In this type of attack, the attacker does not get the results directly. Instead, they infer the presence of vulnerabilities based on the application's behavior (e.g., timing or changes in responses). Blind SQLi is more difficult to detect but still dangerous.

   - **Boolean-based Blind SQLi**: The attacker sends a query that forces the application to return different results depending on the condition (true or false).
   - **Time-based Blind SQLi**: The attacker induces a delay in the database response, which helps infer whether the query is correct.

3. **Out-of-Band SQLi**:  
   This type of SQLi is rare but sophisticated. The attacker relies on the server’s ability to make DNS or HTTP requests to a remote server. Results are retrieved through these external channels, such as by creating DNS requests or HTTP responses.

### **How SQL Injection Works: A Real-World Example**

Consider a user visiting a login page with a vulnerable form. If the application doesn’t properly sanitize user input, an attacker could enter the following SQL code in the username or password field:

```sql
' OR 1=1 --
```

This could turn the SQL query into:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = 'userpassword';
```

Since `1=1` is always true, the query would return all records in the database, potentially allowing the attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system.

### **How to Detect SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**
Using **Sentinel**, Rebackk’s AI-powered vulnerability scanner, you can easily detect SQL Injection vulnerabilities in your web applications. Here’s how to use it:

1. **Run a Scan**:
   ```bash
   npx sentinel-scanner sqli -s <path_to_spider_results>
   ```
2. **Analyze the Results**:
   - Sentinel generates a detailed report, highlighting any SQLi vulnerabilities detected in your web application.
   - It offers actionable recommendations to fix the vulnerabilities.

### **Best Practices for Preventing SQL Injection Attacks**

1. **Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)**:
   - Prepared statements ensure that user inputs are treated as data and not executable code. This is the most effective way to prevent SQLi.
   
   Example (in PHP with PDO):
   ```php
   $stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username');
   $stmt->execute(['username' => $userInput]);
   ```

2. **Sanitize and Escape User Inputs**:
   - Use input validation and sanitization to ensure that data entered by users is safe.
   - Use functions like `mysqli_real_escape_string` (in PHP) to escape dangerous characters.

3. **Use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) Frameworks**:
   - ORM libraries automatically handle query generation, reducing the risk of SQLi by using parameterized queries behind the scenes.

4. **Limit Database Permissions**:
   - Ensure that the database account used by the web application has the least amount of privilege necessary to function. For example, avoid using an admin account for web application queries.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Avoid exposing detailed database error messages to users. Use generic error messages to prevent attackers from gaining insight into your database structure.

6. **Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**:
   - A WAF can help detect and block malicious SQLi attempts before they reach your application.
